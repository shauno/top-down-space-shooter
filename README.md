top-down-space-shooter
======================

I've been meaning to play with Apache Cordova for some time, so here's my first attempt.

It's a very rough, but working top-down shooter style 'engine', that runs in a web browser if you just browse to www/index.html. It will also run as an Android app when built with Apache Cordova, using the Accelerometer plugin.
